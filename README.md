## 🔑 API Configuration
This project uses the *OpenWeatherMap API*.

Since this is a **frontend-only project**, the API key is added directly in the JavaScript file.

### Steps to add your API key:
1. Get a free API key from: https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Open `script.js`
3. Replace the placeholder:
   ```js
   const API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY";
